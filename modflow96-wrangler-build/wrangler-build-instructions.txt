MODFLOW 96 Wrangler Build Usage Notes
2016.06.15

_________________________

Notes:

There are two scripts to build MODFLOW 96, one is optimized and one is not.
These instructions detail using the optimized build scripts.
In order to use the unoptimized build script, simply substitute he correct file name as follows:

    Wherever you see:  'modflow.wra.build'
    Replace it with:  'modflow.wra_noopt.build'

Do NOT run these in the same location.
To build the alternative version you need to start with a fresh modflow96-wrangler-build copy.

_________________________

Usage Instructions:

1. Copy cyrus-wrangler-build directory from UT Box into Wrangler home directory.
Requires downloading to local system first, then scp files up to wrangler:

    $ scp /path/to/local/copy/modflow96-wrangler-build USERNAME@wrangler.tacc.utexas.edu:/home/NUMBER/USERNAME

2. Connect to wrangler:

    $ ssh USERNAME@wrangler.tac.utexas.edu

3. cd into cyrus-wrangler-build directory

    $ cd modflow96-wrangler-build

4. Make the build script executable:

    $ chmod +x modflow.wra.build

5. Run the build script:

    $ ./modflow.wra.build

6. Verify that you have a folder named modflw96.3_3

    $ ll

7. Change directories into the modflw96.3_3 folder:

    $ cd modflw96.3_3

8. Verify that there is an executable in the /bin directory:

    $ cd bin && ls bin

    (look for 'modflw96' )

9. Test running modflow:

    $ modflw96
    Enter the name of the NAME FILE:

    ** This means success.
    Press CTRL + C to halt the script.

10. Export modflow as an environment variable so you can use it from anywhere:

    $ export PATH=${PATH}:${PWD}/modflw96.3_3/bin
    (OLD COMMAND: $ export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/modflow96-wrangler-build/modflw96.3_3/bin)

11. Verify that the binary is now in the system path:

    $ echo $PATH

    Look for: .:/Path/To/Build/modflw96.3_3/bin appended to the output.

12. Verify modflow works from anywhere:

    $ cd 
    $ modflw96.3_3
    Enter the name of the NAME FILE:

    ** This means success.
    Press CTRL + C to halt the script.

13. Upload GAM files to your working directory on HPC system using scp command again.

14. Get an interactiove node to work in:

    $ idev

    This will eventually chnage your prompt from 'login' to 'c###-###' which means you are now working on a node.

15. Run your simulations!

16. Use scp to copy your output.dat files back to your local system as well.

From Cyrus Proctor
(creator of the makefile patches and build scripts, bringer of light =P)

Okay, you can find the two files you need in `/home/03325/jgentle/modflow/cyrus` 
which are `modflow.wra.build` (the build script) 
and `modflow.makefile.patch` (the patch file for the Makefile). 

Open `modflow.wra.build`, 
verify the `${modflow}` is the absolute path where you are located, 
verify the tarball is in the same directory, 
and run the build script with './modflow.wra.build` 
and you'll get the executable in the modflow `bin` directory.

Inside the original Makefile, the variable `F77` has special meaning. 
To update it, you simply change the variable name from `F77` to `FC` (or something else), 
and then update the rest. The patch file changes this, 
adds the optimization flags `-O3 -xHOST` and uses ifort for compilation. 

I strongly suggest that you compare output of this executable to known output generated back in 2000. 
Updating compilers, architectures, and build flags will very likely land you different results. 
You all need to verify that they are within whatever tolerance is acceptable. 
In my experience working in the nuclear industry where legacy codes are king, 
being able to upgrade and reproduce results are imperative -- I would assume the same for USGS.

Good luck and have fun!
